# About

Stylo Doodles is a an community driven image gallery. All images have been
created with the Python package [stylo](https://github.com/alcarney/stylo).
Stylo aims to give people with imaginations bigger than their drawing skills
the chance to make their visions a reality with a little bit of help from the
worlds of mathematics and Python.

This gallery is a place where newcomers to stylo can come to see what is
possible and get inspiration for their own projects. Somewhere anyone can
submit and share their own creations and help inspire the rest of the
community.

Want to find out more? Then head over to the
[documentation](https://alcarney.github.io/stylo) for information on how to get
up and running with stylo.

Want to submit your own image? Check out the [Submit](./submit.html) page for details on
how you can get your own creations included.
