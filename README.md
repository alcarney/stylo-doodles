# Stylo Doodles

**This project is no longer active. It has been migrated into the main `arlunio` repository**

[Gallery](https://www.arlun.io/gallery)

[Repo](https://github.com/swyddfa/arlunio)

This repository is the backend implementaion of the
[Stylo Doodles](https://alcarney.github.io/stylo-doodles) example gallery and
community website for [stylo](https://github.com/alcarney/stylo) the Python
package for creating images and animations with a little bit of mathematics.

## Running the Examples

If you want to play with any of the example images yourself you need the
following python packages installed

- stylo
- jupyter

These can be installed using `pip`

```
$ pip install jupyter stylo
```

With those packages installed run the following command from the `notebooks/`
folder

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will open a page in your browser allowing to choose a notebook and start
interacting with it.

Don't want to install anything? Just click on [this](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alcarney/stylo-doodles/master)
link to try the examples live in your browser! (It will take a few minutes to
load)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether that is contributing an image to the gallery
or working on the code that generates the website itself.

### Contribute an Image

Have you made something with stylo you'd like to share? Here is how you get
your image included in the gallery!

You need to to write the code for your image in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
Then so that your notebook can integrate with the website's build system you
also need to do the following.

1. Your image *must* be stored in a variable called `image`
2. You also need to define a dictionary called `info` *in the very first cell
   of the notebook*.

This dictionary needs to contain the following information

```python
info = {
 "title": "Your Image Title",
 "author": "Your Name",
 "github_username": "your_github_username",
 "stylo_version": "0.6.0",
 "dimensions": (1920, 1080)
}
```

- `stylo_version`: Should be set to the value of `stylo.__version__` when
 you created your image.
- `dimensions`: Should be set to the tuple `(width, height)`. These
 dimensions will be used when the full size version of your image is
 generated by the build.

You can use the existing [notebooks](https://github.com/alcarney/stylo-doodles/tree/master/notebooks)
as a guide. Be sure to drop by the stylo [gitter](https://gitter.im/stylo-py/Lobby)
chat room if you get stuck we'll be happy to help!

### Contribute to the Site Generator

Currently the website is built using a custom Pyton script with some Jinja
templating thrown in. Take a look in `site_builder.py` for an overview of the
process. The resulting website is rather basic so there are certainly plenty of
features that could be added!
